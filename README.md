# Heart Disease Prediction
## PROJECT NOTEBOOK: [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/FinnianHBLR/Health-Data-Project---Heart-Failure-Prediction/blob/f1307f165cdb069a51ee603eea7f08a10547bcfe/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction%20by%20Finnian%20Logan-Riley.ipynb)

*Author: Finnian Logan-Riley*  

I consider this my magnum opus of data processing. However, much was learnt and there is space for improvement, mainly around neural networks.

> Hypothesis - Is it possible to predict heart disease events?  

> Hypothesis answer: Yes!

### Key Strategies
* Data exploration
* Data repair (KNN imputer) 
* Data cleaning

* Model combining
* Neural networks
* Automatic neural network optimizer
* Traditional data analysis techniques 
    * Linear regression
    * Multivariate plots 
    * Scatter plots
    * Pairplot classification
    * Feature selection
    * Value standardization
    * Logistic regression
    * Confusion matrix
    * Univariate histograms
    * Box and whisker plot
